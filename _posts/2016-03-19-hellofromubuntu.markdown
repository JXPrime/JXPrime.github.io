# Hello, Ubuntu!

Since the things I use Windows for on my main laptop are fairly limited (Quicken, VS 2015), I figured I'd give dual-booting the latest Ubuntu stable a try.

When did this get so easy? I remember trying this 10 years ago or so and it was a damned nightmare. Windows 10 is able to resize my main partition with no troubles, the Ubuntu installer installed itself sidebyside with no troubles. So far, everything has "just worked", which I never would have thought possible with Linux.

I've got Visual Studio Code, Docker, even [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) running through Mono. I'm flummoxed, and completely amazed. Ready to dig in.
